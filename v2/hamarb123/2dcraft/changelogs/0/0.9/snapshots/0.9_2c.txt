Version 0.9 Snapshot 2c:
	Improve performance
	Improve text rendering performance
	Add a new proportional font (except in F3 where it is monospace)
	Increase default world widths (129 -> 257, 193 -> 385, 257 -> 513, 393 -> 769, 769 -> 1025) due to better optimised code (note: there is no way to extend the world at the moment)
	Increase biome sizes to roughly reflect world size changes (x1.5)
	Fancier sky, sun & moon rendering
	Change game scale (ie. blocks look smaller etc.) & rebalance other values to suit
	Extended hotbar to 11 items
	Extended inventory to 4 rows
	Add Black Tulip, Lime Green Rose and Fertiliser
	Improve rendering on high resolution displays (previously, some textures were more in the wrong spot)
	Add more options
	Make bars that make the rendering be 16:9 black by default, which looks better on most screens
	Fix different colour wools stacking together
	Fix a glitch that when a block is at (0, 0) and you can see it, that a lot of the physics completely breaks
	Fix other bugs
	Note: Mod maker is broken
